If Disabling Sticky Keys through your Settings Panel -> Ease of Access GUI does NOT work, do the following:

Make the following changes to your Registry.
 
1.     Disable Sticky Keys 
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Accessibility\StickyKeys]
“Flags”=”506?
2.     Disable Filter Keys 
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Accessibility\Keyboard Response]
“Flags”=”122?
3.     Disable Toggle Keys 
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Accessibility\ToggleKeys]
“Flags”=”58?
 
Note: one can completely disable accessibility options by renaming/deleting the registry-node Accessibility (above)
Hope it helps.
 
After change is done, LOG OFF and LOG back on or just restart PC.
